This program is a continuation of our Mastermind game created in assignment 2 of 422C.

For the program to work properly, run the MyServer class first followed by 3 different clients that wish to play
From there the server will generate a secret code for all three clients to try to guess.
All clients are independent of each other, but are racing to guess the secret word first.

Clients that no longer wish to play can exit out once the round has ended. The server will end the game once all
original clients have disconnected. The server will then continue to listen for 3 more clients to begin the game again.

Hope you enjoy!
